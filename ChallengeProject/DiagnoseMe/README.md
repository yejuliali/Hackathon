# DiagnoseMe (en)
Diagnosis and geolocation solution in real time for suspected cases of COVID-19

In order to reduce the risk of transmission of  on the way to the hospital and promote rapid management, our project will implement a mobile application for remote self-diagnosis of symptoms (thanks to connected objects) and suspected case mapping  so that a specialized ambulance can travel to the scene to remove the suspected patient.
   
# MAINS FUNCTIONS
-FAQ on COVID-19 (HELP)
-Remote Diagnose
-Get the constants of the user using captors and make the diagnosis
-Prevention (TIPS)
-Geolocation and Management of the suspected cases by Hospital 
-Hospital Notification
-Chat with suspect patient

# WHY THE PROJET ?
To fight an epidemic, limit the spread. This requires isolation of suspected cases and rapid management. 
However for COVID-19, in the absence of isolation measure, each sick person can affect two.
And people can be contagious very early on when symptoms start, or even before they appear. Our Project responds to this problem. The objective is to bring this figure below one, in order to stem proliferation.
The objectives of the DiagnoseMe project are:
-Permit remote Symptomes detection of Virus
-Facilitate the detection of suspect cases and their rapid management
-Quickly and securely sort people based on their risk of COVID-19 infection and provide -adequate care (those who must be confined to the home, referred to a care facility or isolated in an emergency)

#PROJECT ROLES

# HOW TO USE?
After a travel or presence on public place 
1.  Open DiagnoseMe;
2. Enter your age, location and contact;
